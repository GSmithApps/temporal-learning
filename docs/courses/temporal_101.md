In this course, you will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal: Workflows and Activities. You’ll use these building blocks along with Temporal's SDKs to develop an application that communicates with an external service. You'll see how Temporal helps you recover from failures. You’ll explore event history and gain familiarity with the Temporal Web UI and Temporal’s command-line tool, and you'll manage workflows using code and command line tools.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

- Configure an environment for developing Temporal Applications
- Use Temporal to describe and implement a business process.
- Interpret workflow execution event histories
- Use Temporal’s tooling to manage the lifecycle of your application
