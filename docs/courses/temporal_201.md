In this course you'll go beyond basic workflow execution. You'll use Temporal to build a small application that manages user subscriptions. You'll create long-running Workflows that execute activities repeatedly, and you'll use Signals and Queries to interact with your running Workflows.

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

- Implement Workflows with multiple steps and outcomes.
- Use Signals to alter workflow execution
- Use queries to retrieve values from workflows.
To be successful in this course, you should have completed the Temporal 101 course or be able to create Temporal Workflows, Activities, and Workers that run basic workflow executions.
